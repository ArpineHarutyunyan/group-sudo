1. Create two directories with some files. Use nfs to share one of them as read only, the other
must be writable. Have your neighbour connect to them to test.
	sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common
	sudo nano /etc/exports ... /home/student/Desktop/linux *(rw)
	sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart
	sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.2:/home/student/Desktop/linux /media

2. Investigate the user owner of the files created by your neighbour.
	ls -al/username

3. Protect a share by ip-address or hostname, so only your neighbour can connect.
	/home/student/Desktop/linux 192.168.0.55(rw)
